    Find Reddit discussions showing REAL BUYING INTENT for: {search_query}

    TARGET SUBREDDITS (prioritize these):
    - r/sales - Sales professionals discussing tools and pain points
    - r/entrepreneur - Founders with budget authority
    - r/startups - Early-stage companies evaluating first tools
    - r/SaaS - SaaS operators and founders
    - r/smallbusiness - Small business owners (budget-conscious)

    SEARCH STRATEGY:
    Use the Reddit Discussion Search tool to find posts matching these patterns:

    1. HELP REQUESTS (Highest Intent):
       - "Can anyone recommend a [solution]?"
       - "What do you use for [problem]?"
       - "Looking for [tool type]"

    2. COMPLAINT THREADS (High Intent):
       - "Why is [problem] so hard?"
       - "[Competitor] is too expensive/slow/complicated"
       - "Frustrated with [current solution]"

    3. ALTERNATIVE SEARCHES (High Intent):
       - "Cheaper alternative to [competitor]?"
       - "[Product A] vs [Product B]"
       - "Switching from [old tool]"

    4. PROBLEM DISCUSSIONS (Medium Intent):
       - "How do you solve [specific problem]?"
       - "Struggling with [pain point]"
       - "Need better way to [task]"

    PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA:
    - Focus on discussions with 10+ comments (active engagement = validated pain point)
    - Prioritize recent posts (last 30 days) for timing advantage
    - Look for posts with HIGH upvotes (community validation)
    - Note posts where MULTIPLE people express same problem in comments

    REDDIT-SPECIFIC INSIGHTS:
    - Reddit usernames are often anonymous, so focus on the PROBLEM not the person
    - A highly-upvoted post means many people have the same pain
    - Active comment threads indicate urgent, unresolved problems
    - Cross-reference: If same problem appears in multiple subreddits = widespread need

    TIME FILTER: Use "month" for freshness (problems discussed recently)
    RESULTS TARGET: 20-50 discussions showing clear intent signals

    4. INTENT SCORE (from tool output):

       - 60-79: HIGH - Strong complaint or clear alternative search
       - 40-59: MEDIUM - Problem discussion with moderate engagement
       - Below 40: Filter out (weak signal)

    5. DISCUSSION URL:
       - Direct Reddit link for reference

    6. KEY INSIGHT:
       - Why this is a qualified lead signal
       - What action to take (e.g., "Multiple people in comments asking for same solution")

    SUMMARY SECTION:
    - Total discussions found
    - Top 3 pain points discovered
    - Subreddits with highest intent
    - Recommended follow-up actions

    NOTE: Reddit is great for INTENT DISCOVERY but weak for CONTACT EXTRACTION.
    Use these signals to understand market pain points, then cross-reference with LinkedIn
    for actual decision-makers at companies discussing these problems.
