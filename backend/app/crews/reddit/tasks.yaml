    A prioritized list of Reddit discussions showing buying intent:

    For each discussion include:

    1. INTENT SIGNAL: What problem they're discussing
       - Quote the most compelling part of the post
       - Classify intent type: help_request, complaint, alternative_search, problem_discussion

    2. ENGAGEMENT METRICS:
       - Upvotes (community validation)
       - Comment count (discussion depth)
       - Post age (timing)

    3. SUBREDDIT CONTEXT:
       - Which subreddit (indicates community/audience)
       - Why this subreddit is relevant to the search query

    4. INTENT SCORE (from tool output):
       - 80-100: VERY HIGH - Explicit request or very active discussion
       - 60-79: HIGH - Strong complaint or clear alternative search
       - 40-59: MEDIUM - Problem discussion with moderate engagement
       - Below 40: Filter out (weak signal)

    5. DISCUSSION URL:
       - Direct Reddit link for reference

    6. KEY INSIGHT:
       - Why this is a qualified lead signal
       - What action to take (e.g., "Multiple people in comments asking for same solution")

    SUMMARY SECTION:
    - Total discussions found
    - Top 3 pain points discovered
    - Subreddits with highest intent
    - Recommended follow-up actions

    NOTE: Reddit is great for INTENT DISCOVERY but weak for CONTACT EXTRACTION.
    Use these signals to understand market pain points, then cross-reference with LinkedIn
    for actual decision-makers at companies discussing these problems.
