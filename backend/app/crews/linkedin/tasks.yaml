    Find LinkedIn prospects with REAL BUYING INTENT using these tools:

    TOOL 1 - LinkedIn Posts Search (PRIMARY for intent detection):
    Search for posts about: {search_query}
    This finds people actively posting about problems, needs, or evaluations.

    TOOL 2 - LinkedIn People Search (SECONDARY for decision-makers):
    Find people by title/location if needed.

    TOOL 3 - LinkedIn Profile Detail (for top 3-5 candidates):
    Enrich best prospects with email and contact data.

    STRATEGY:
    1. Use Posts Search FIRST to find intent signals (complaints, questions, evaluations)
    2. Extract author profile URLs from posts
    3. Optionally search for decision-makers if posts don't yield enough leads
    4. Enrich top 3-5 prospects with Profile Detail tool for contact info

    Return prospects with:
    - What problem they posted about (the intent signal)
    - Their profile data (name, title, company)
    - Contact info if enriched (email, phone)
    - Timing (how recent the signal is)
