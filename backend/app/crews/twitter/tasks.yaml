    TWITTER SEARCH STRATEGY:
    Use the Twitter Intent Search tool to find tweets matching these intent patterns:

    1. HELP REQUESTS (Highest Intent - Immediate Need):
       - "Anyone recommend a [solution]?"
       - "What's the best [tool type]?"
       - "Need help finding [specific solution]"
       - "Looking for recommendations on [problem]"

    2. COMPLAINT TWEETS (Very High Intent - Ready to Switch):
       - "So frustrated with [current tool]"
       - "[Competitor] is terrible/awful/useless"
       - "Can't believe [tool] doesn't have [feature]"
       - "Time to switch from [competitor]"

    3. EVALUATION TWEETS (High Intent - Active Decision Process):
       - "[Tool A] vs [Tool B] - which is better?"
       - "Comparing [solution options]"
       - "Switching from [old tool], what should I use?"
       - "Trying to decide between [alternatives]"

    4. PROBLEM TWEETS (Medium Intent - Pain Point Identified):
       - "Struggling to [specific task]"
       - "How do you solve [problem]?"
       - "Is there a better way to [process]?"
       - "[Specific challenge] is killing our productivity"

    SEARCH EXECUTION:
    Run multiple targeted searches to capture different intent signals:

    - Primary search: Exact query (e.g., "looking for CRM")
    - Competitor search: "[Competitor name] alternative"
    - Problem search: "frustrated with [problem area]"
    - Recommendation search: "recommend [solution type]"

    Use query_type="Top" for most relevant tweets (higher quality)
    Use query_type="Latest" for freshest signals (recent activity)

    Focus on tweets that show strong buying intent:

    - Intent Score: Prioritize 60+ scores (HIGH and VERY HIGH intent)
    - Recency: Tweets from last 30 days (fresher = warmer lead)
    - Engagement: 10+ likes OR 5+ retweets OR 5+ replies (validated pain)
    - Author Influence: 1K+ followers (likely decision-maker)
    - Verified Accounts: Higher credibility and authority
