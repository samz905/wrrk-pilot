    Find companies with recent buying triggers related to: {search_query}

    SEARCH STRATEGY:
    Use Google SERP Search tool and Website Crawler tool to find company trigger events.

    TOOL 1 - Google SERP Search (PRIMARY for finding articles):
    Search for recent news about: {search_query}

    Effective search queries to try:
    1. FUNDING TRIGGERS:
       - "[Industry] Series A funding" (past month)
       - "[Industry] raises $" (past month)
       - "startup funding [problem domain]"

    2. LEADERSHIP CHANGES:
       - "new CTO hired [industry]"
       - "VP Sales appointed [industry]"
       - "[job title] joins [industry]"

    3. EXPANSION SIGNALS:
       - "[industry] opens new office"
       - "[industry] expands to [region]"
       - "hiring spree [industry]"

    4. PROBLEM ANNOUNCEMENTS:
       - "company struggles with [problem]"
       - "[industry] faces [challenge]"
       - "data breach [industry]" (if relevant)

    5. COMPETITOR MENTIONS:
       - "switching from [competitor]"
       - "[company] evaluating [tool category]"
       - "replacing [incumbent solution]"

    TOOL 2 - Website Crawler (SECONDARY for detailed context):
    For the most promising articles found in SERP:
    - Crawl the full article to extract:
      - Exact company names mentioned
      - Specific trigger details (funding amount, exec names, etc.)
      - Timing information (when did this happen)
      - Context about the company's needs

    PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA:
    - Recency: Events from last 30 days are HOT (likely actively buying)
    - Authority: TechCrunch, Business Insider, industry publications > blogs
    - Specificity: "DataCorp raised $50M" > "Startup raises funding"
    - Relevance: Company's problem/trigger aligns with our solution

    TIME FILTER: Use date_range="30d" or "90d" for recent triggers
    RESULTS TARGET: 30-50 company trigger events

  expected_output: |
    A prioritized list of companies with recent buying triggers:

    For each company include:

    1. COMPANY NAME & TRIGGER:
       - Exact company name
       - Trigger type: funding, leadership_change, expansion, problem, competitor_mention
       - Specific details: "$20M Series B" or "New CTO hired: Jane Smith"

    2. TIMING:
       - Date of trigger event
       - Days ago (for urgency scoring)
       - Buy window estimate: "Next 30-60 days likely active"

    3. SOURCE INFORMATION:
       - Article title and URL
       - Publication (TechCrunch, etc.)
       - Key quote from article showing the trigger

    4. RELEVANCE SCORE (0-100):
       - 90-100: Perfect match - company explicitly discussing our problem domain
       - 70-89: Strong match - trigger type indicates need for our solution
       - 50-69: Good match - industry/timing right, less explicit need
       - Below 50: Filter out (weak signal)

    5. NEXT STEPS:
       - LinkedIn search suggestion: "VP of Sales at [Company]"
       - Why this is actionable: "Just raised $50M, hiring 20 sales reps → needs CRM"

    SUMMARY SECTION:
    - Total triggers found
    - Top 3 trigger types discovered
    - Hottest companies (most recent/relevant)
    - Recommended LinkedIn cross-reference strategy

    NOTE: Google is great for COMPANY DISCOVERY but weak for CONTACT EXTRACTION.
    Use these company names to then search LinkedIn for decision-makers at these
    companies who are likely driving the buying process.
