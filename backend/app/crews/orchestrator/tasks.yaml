    Find high-intent leads for the product described below.

    PRODUCT: {product_description}
    TARGET: {target_leads} qualified leads with intent score >= 60
    ICP CRITERIA: {icp_criteria}

    == EXECUTION STRATEGY ==

    STEP 1: ANALYZE THE QUERY
    - Identify the product type (B2B SaaS, developer tool, enterprise, SMB)
    - Determine the best target personas (job titles, seniority)
    - List the most likely pain points and keywords

    STEP 2: CHOOSE INITIAL APPROACH
    - Intent signals: Find people actively discussing problems/seeking solutions
    - Company triggers: Find companies with buying signals (funding, hiring, growth)
    - Hybrid: Combine both approaches

    STEP 3: EXECUTE SEARCHES
    Use the Intent Signal Hunter tool to search across platforms:
    - LinkedIn: Professional discussions, complaints, recommendations
    - Reddit: Honest user discussions, tool comparisons
    - Twitter: Real-time frustrations, help requests

    STEP 4: REFLECT AND ADAPT
    After each tool call, REFLECT on results:

    QUANTITY CHECK:
    - Got 0 results? Try different keywords or different platform
    - Got < 5 results? Broaden the search or try synonyms
    - Got > 20 results? Good, proceed to next step

    QUALITY CHECK:
    - Are results relevant to the query?
    - Do people show genuine buying intent?
    - Are these the right job titles?

    ADAPT if needed:
    - "These LinkedIn results are mostly sellers, let me try Reddit"
    - "Query 'CRM software' is too broad, let me try 'Salesforce alternative'"
    - "Not finding intent signals, switching to company trigger approach"

    STEP 5: ENRICH HIGH-VALUE LEADS
    For leads with intent_score >= 70:
    - Use Decision Maker Finder to get detailed profile data
    - Look for email and phone if available

    STEP 6: SCORE AND FILTER
    Use Lead Scorer tool or manually score each lead:
    - Intent strength: 35%
    - Title/seniority match: 25%
    - Company fit: 20%
    - Platform multiplicity: 10%
    - Contact completeness: 10%

    == EXAMPLE SCENARIOS ==

    EXAMPLE 1: Design Agent for Founders
    Query: "Find leads for our AI design agent that helps startups ship UI faster"

    Reasoning:
    1. Product: AI design tool for startups
    2. Target: Founders, Head of Product, Design leads
    3. Best signals: Design bottleneck discussions

    Approach: Intent signals on LinkedIn + Reddit
    - LinkedIn query: "frustrated with design" "hiring designers" "design bottleneck"

    1. Product: CRM (competitor to Salesforce)
    2. Target: VP Sales, RevOps, CRO
    3. Best signals: Salesforce complaints, pricing discussions

    Approach: Intent signals first, then company triggers

    - Google: "companies hiring Salesforce Admin" (budget signal)

    Results: 28 qualified leads combining complaint signals + decision makers

    EXAMPLE 3: Code Review Tool
    Query: "Find engineering managers who need faster code review"

    Reasoning:
    1. Product: Code review tool
    2. Target: Engineering Manager, VP Eng, Director of Eng
    3. Best signals: PR bottleneck, code review discussions

    Approach: Reddit + Twitter first (dev communities), then LinkedIn enrichment
    - Reddit: "code review bottleneck" "PR review time" in r/programming
    - Twitter: "code review" "PR backlog"
    - LinkedIn: Engineering Managers at mid-size tech companies
