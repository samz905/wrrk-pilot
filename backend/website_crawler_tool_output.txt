Everyone in a company should be using a CRM system.

People are not happy with their CRM systems. That's the conclusion of a [new survey](https://www.sugarcrm.com/hd-cx/content/crm-sales-impact/ "https://www.sugarcrm.com/hd-cx/content/crm-sales-impact/") of more than 1,000 sales professionals and decision-makers from CRM software vendor [SugarCRM](http://www.sugarcrm.com/ "http://www.sugarcrm.com/").

According to the survey:

· 52 percent of sales leaders reported that their CRM platform is costing potential revenue opportunities;

· 50 percent of the companies said they cannot access customer data across marketing, sales and service systems;

· Nearly one-third complained that their customer data is incomplete, out of date, or inaccurate;

· 53 percent of respondents said that the administrative burdens of their CRM system causes friction for their sales team and

· 57 percent said that they have trouble predicting when customers will churn and 48 percent of those surveyed say they don’t know why customers have churned.

"A new reality came into focus in 2020," says SugarCRM's CEO Craig Charlton. "Companies are having a customer relationship crisis. 48 percent (of the sales leaders and decision-makers surveyed) reported that their CRM doesn’t meet their needs, providing an insufficient, out-of-date view of customers. In fact, our research reveals a picture of companies struggling with platforms and data practices riddled with blind spots and roadblocks."
